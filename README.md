## Overview

This project implements a personal AI assistant leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system with a UI developed in pure JavaScript. The assistant is designed to replicate all steps that a user might perform themselves, offering a robust guide for building a similar bot. The UI can be seamlessly injected into any website by referencing the JavaScript link, ensuring ease of integration.

---

## Key Features
- **Fully Configurable RAG-Based AI Assistant:** The assistant uses a RAG system to provide precise, context-aware responses.
- **UI Built with Pure JavaScript:** Easily embed the assistant into any website using a simple JS link.
- **Local and Remote AI Provider Support:** Supports local LLMs like Llama or external providers for faster, scalable processing.
- **End-to-End Guide:** Comprehensive setup instructions covering data preparation, vector database creation, and API deployment.

## Setting Up the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment
To isolate project dependencies, create a virtual environment using Python:

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows:**
  ```bash
  .\env\Scripts\activate
  ```

- **macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source env/bin/activate
  ```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Llama LLM Preparation (For Local Integration)
1. Download and install OLLAMA from [here](https://ollama.com/download).
2. Pull a Llama LLM locally, e.g., [Llama 3.2](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2):
   ```bash
   ollama run llama3.2
   ```
3. For embeddings, install the `mxbai-embed-large` network:
   ```bash
   ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
   ```

#### 4.1 Data Preparation
Prepare your assistant with knowledge about your company or service:
1. Update `data/links.txt` with the web links to scrape data from, one URL per line. Example:
   ```
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/about
   https://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/
   https://news.microsoft.com/source/
   ```
2. Run the `scrapper.py` script to parse and save data in markdown format:
   ```bash
   python3 scrapper.py
   ```

#### 4.2 Data Ingestion
To store the parsed data in a vector database:
1. Use ChromaDB, which works efficiently with SQLite.
2. Run the `ingest.py` script to populate the database:
   ```bash
   python3 ingest.py
   ```

Once completed, the assistant is ready for use.

### 5. Run the API
Start the API server using FastAPI:
```bash
fastapi run
```

### 5.1 Switching Between Providers
The project supports multiple providers for processing AI queries:

1. **Default Local Llama Provider:**
   Ensure the local Llama network is running as described in Step 4.

2. **Alternative Provider - Together.ai:**
  - Register at [Together.ai](https://www.together.ai/).
  - Obtain your API key.
  - Create a `.env` file with the following content:
    ```
    TOGETHER_API_KEY="<YOUR KEY>"
    ```
  - Update `main.py` to switch the provider:
    ```python
    from providers.ollama import query_rag
    ```
    Change to:
    ```python
    from providers.together import query_rag
    ```
  - Restart the service to apply changes.

### 6. Verify the Setup
Open the browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/public/chat.html](http://127.0.0.1:8000/public/chat.html). Test the bot's functionality and start interacting with your assistant.
As an alternative you can open [http://127.0.0.1:8000/public/iframe.html](http://127.0.0.1:8000/public/iframe.html) to see how it can be ingested on you custom page.
